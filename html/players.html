                            Kobe Bean Bryant (August 23, 1978 â€“ January 26, 2020) was an American professional
                            basketball player. A shooting guard,
                            he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National
                            Basketball Association (NBA).
                            Widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players and scorers of all time,
                            Bryant won five NBA championships,
                            was an 18-time All-Star, a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the
                            All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP),
                            and a two-time NBA Finals MVP. Bryant also led the NBA in scoring twice, and ranks
                            fourth in league all-time regular season and postseason scoring.
                            He was posthumously voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and
                            named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.
                            The all-time leading scorer in Lakers history, Bryant was the first guard in NBA history
                            to play 20 seasons.
                            His 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, and he has the most
                            consecutive appearances as a starter.
                            Bryant's four NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most in NBA
                            history. He gave himself the nickname "Black Mamba"
                            in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. He won
                            gold medals on the 2008 and 2012 U.S. Olympic teams.
                            In 2018, he won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for the film Dear
                            Basketball (2017). Bryant died, along with his daughter Gianna
                            and seven others, in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, in 2020. A number of
                            tributes and memorials were subsequently issued,
                            including renaming the All-Star MVP Award in his honor.
